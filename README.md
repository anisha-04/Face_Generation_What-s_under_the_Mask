# Face_Generation_What-s_under_the_Mask


In this project, our ideal goal is to take images of someone wearing a mask and replace the mask with an accurate representation of their actual face. We hope to have a high resolution output image that would be believable to the untrained eye. We would also like to use a variety of data to train our model. Faces are very unique and we would like to have a very general output.

We have a few constraints working against us. Those being time, data, and compute power. Due to these constraints, we also have a more modest goal. We should be able to generate unmasked images that, at the very least, look like a face. We also acknowledge that our only dataset, at this point, consists of celebrities and may not provide a generalized output. We may also have to reduce the resolution of our output images in order to speed up training.
